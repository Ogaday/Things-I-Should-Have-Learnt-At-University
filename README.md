# Things I (Should Have) Learnt At University

A reference for the union of the set of valuable things I learnt at university and the set of things I feel should have, but didn't.

Unquestionably, I learnt a lot in the last three years, both within and beyond the curriculum and course contents. However, I also feel that I missed many important concepts and fundamentals that were available to me. Ideally, I will be able to revisit the all of the important things I did and didn't learn at university.

Ideally, this could eventually provide the foundation for a blog, lessons for others and a back up of the work I did in the course of my degree.
